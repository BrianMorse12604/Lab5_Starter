1. We don't think so, testing the "message" feature involves many moving parts, one user successfully sending the message, the other user receiving the message, and any other parts that may be involved in the processs. These parts are all interacting and thus can not be tested on unit testing scale
2. Yes, we can use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature since we can easily debug and test this small feature with some example messages being too long, or working with the limitation
